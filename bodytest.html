<p>My first experience with coding was an excited 12 year old with his first angelfire website. The purpose of the site and the reason why I felt the need to make the site are a bit hazy, but I will never forget the frustrated hour I spent, wringing my heads and cursing the heavens.</p>
<p id="italic">"Why O Why won't this image link work? I've done everything!"</p>
<p>In the end it was because I kept typing in <span id="code">"some_image______.jpg"</span> instead of <span id="code">"some_image_______.jpg"</span>. Needless to say, learning about snake_case and camelCase were blessings.</p>

<p>Despite my initial crash and burn, building themes and mark up languages have always really interested me. While I've spent most of my time focusing on the artistic side of design, pursuing illustration, graphic design and other forms of visual art, I've always had a huge interest in front end development and mark up languages.</p>

<div class="bio-blurb">
<p>In my off time, I've played around with website building and using the wealth of online resources to learn as much as I can about CSS, HTML, Javascript and more recently Ruby, SCSS and JQuery and get more excited with each new function and possibility I find.</p>
<p>I recently had the opportunity to take part in a six week code learning bootcamp which was a deep dive into learning Ruby and building web apps with Sinatra and then Rails. It was a great experience that taught me a lot and really reignited my passion for building functional and good looking UX.</p>
